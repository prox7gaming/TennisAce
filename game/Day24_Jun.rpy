    "Today, for some weird reason, I woke up feeling a little different."
    "Even though mornings don't come to me very easily, I woke up today feeling... light. I was even humming a few songs while I got ready for school."
    "When I stopped to think about it, they have all been songs that I heard Jun playing on the piano."
    "This entire thing feels so very unusual for me."
    "Usually I'm the type to set up multiple alarms in five minute increments just to make sure I don't cancel one and end up waking up late."
    "... And I have no shame in saying that I usually always cancel the first few alarms."
    "But today, and I don't know why that happened, I woke up half an hour before my first alarm feeling... pretty good, actually."
    "I've been in a surprisingly good mood lately but I still could never shake off that feeling of permanent drowsiness."
    "Like no matter how much sleep I get, I'm always tired and wanting more sleep."
    "... I suppose one could just say I'm lazy."
    "I got used to dealing with it when I was younger and was surprisingly active back then."
    "At the very least, no one could really tell that deep down I was a lazy child."
    "But as my motivation tanked in the past few years, I've gotten more and more lazy to the point that teachers began referring to me as a problem child."
    "That thought on its own is already kinda bizarre when I think about my experiences in my old school but once I've gotten used to it I didn't even bat an eye."
    "I suppose I might have just become apathetic towards my own situation."
    "I couldn't really pinpoint the reason why but my attitude started to change very slowly once again."
    "I wasn't quite sure when it was that I began looking forward to facing my daily routine again."
    "But recently, after being forcefully made aware of one fact I hadn't notice until now, my perception started to change."

    "Once I became aware of that fact, I started feeling really uncomfortable."
    "First of all, how could someone change my life that much without me realizing?"
    "Even if I was just keeping an eye on him because I felt like he was some kind of helpless, stray kitten that I needed to take care off."
    "The reality is that little by little I saw myself getting more involved in his life."
    "Watching him rehearse, going to his piano competitions, playing games together, meeting his family, helping him study, going out with all on my own."
    "It was right around the time that I first met Jun that I felt myself being jolted awake and becoming active again."
    "Until then, I was just happy spacing out in class or even skipping it entirely to laze around in the rooftop."
    "... Going straight home right after class was over and not putting much effort into anything."
    "Hell, I'd only go out with my friends if they went through all the trouble of organizing group outings and dragging me over to them."
    "I didn't even realize how much they were having to coddle me for us to keep at all in contact until just recently."
    "When I think back at it, I feel a pang of guilt welling up in my chest."
    "I really need to apologize at some point for being so self-absorbed. I didn't even know what kind of trouble they'd been going through because I kept pulling away without realizing."
    "I truly am a shameless person."
    "Even as I'm thinking these thoughts over to myself, I can't help but think that this degree of introspection is really unlike me."
    "... Which is a problem in an of itself. I can't keep complaining that Jun lacks self-awareness and then being completely oblivious myself, that's just hypocritical."

    "Having to be lectured in public for saying unnecessary and hurtful things... what am I, a child?"
    "And as I was stuck thinking these weird thoughts, before I noticed, I had already gotten myself ready and arrived to class way earlier than usual."
    "Of course, I spent quite a bit of time spacing out by myself in my own desk... I suppose old habits die hard."
    "I kept fidgeting absentmindedly, constantly looking over to the chair next to mine and waiting for a certain tiger to arrive."
    "God, how pathetic am I? Do I really need Jun to be here to do anything at all?"
    "It's good to think over my own behavior at times but I really don't wanna get stuck thinking things like this all morning."
    "It makes my head hurt..."
    "So I need to find some kind of way to distract myself."
    "It shouldn't be too hard. Most of my classmates are here already... or at least the ones that I have any kind of interaction with."
    "They're spread around in their own groups... I suppose I could just insert myself in one of them and go from there."
    "It's not like it'd be hard. Even if we don't talk often, I like to think that I have a positive relationship with most of them."

    "WOTB: Hello everyone! Hope you all had a good time with this update!"
    "WOTB: I really struggled a lot with this one since, as I'm sure you all noticed, this update has a really tense mood for a big chunk of it."
    "WOTB: I was trying my best to show that off without being heavy handed or out of character and ended up going through a ton of rewrites in my attempt to get it right."
    "WOTB: Hopefully it all came out mostly well. I'll let you all be the judges of it!"
    "WOTB: Until then, I'll see you guys at the next update and thank you all again for your patience!"
