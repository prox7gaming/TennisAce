    "Many people come and go through different stores and restaurants. Most of the more specific places such as sporting goods stores have closed down for the day. Instead, we see multiple eateries and diners opening up."
    "An almost dazzling amount of people come and go through the intersections, enough to make you lose track of your surroundings."
    "It would truly be hard to keep track of my bearings if I weren't so used to it already."
    "Also, being next to a giant like Shoichi does help a lot. People make way for him as he walks, opening a small path through the crowd towards wherever he wants to go."
    "I simply follow from behind, making sure to follow in the path he's opened before it closed down and we end up separated."
    "Boy would it be hard to track him again if I got lost."
    "We take a turn at an intersection I've never been to before. The masses of people slowly dwindle to just a few stragglers here and there. The fluorescent lights of the lampposts slowly turn into traditional paper lanterns."
